Architecture is not always permanent. Erosive building materials, rapid modernization
and -- most recently in places like Syria and Iraq -- war, all play critical roles in
determining the survival and legacy of vernacular architecture. With this in mind, it
is our aim to document pervasive patterns in monumental Central Asian architecture
and tile-work that have survived. By preserving the rich history of the art we
can make it accessible to the current day architect through an open source Grasshopper
plug-in for easy panelization of tessellated tile patterns. This process will
both create a record of these works for future generations as well as allow them to
be translated into something completely modern and malleable.
